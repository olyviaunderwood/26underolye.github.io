              <p class="fundraiser">Me and my friend organised a fundraiser for DECA. We decided to do an online auction and have items from local business and family/friend business. The auction was run through Instagram for one week. We ended up making one thousand dollars. This project was a great learning experience and pushed me outside my comfort zone. We will present our project at DECA State.</p>

               <p class="plan">In this group project we were trying to sell out the first Jazz Game. We came out with a plan for some events and giveaways. We decided on doing a giveaway, partnership, and a morning show interview. One of the parts of this project was to make a calendar showing when the promotions are happening. I made the calandar for the project.</p>
